This script creates text assignments for World of Warcraft raid from Google spreadsheets.
This is a Python script which is invoked manually once per week.
This is a CLI tool.
The tool takes a single argument - path to a TOML file which contains: url to the Google spreadsheet, raid name: one of [MC, BWL, AQ40, Naxx], and page name in the spreadsheet.

The script reads a Google Sheets document or just one page, accesses separate cells, and prints out text assignments into a text file. The spreadsheet is publicly available by URL.

Prefer suggesting type hints for variables, arguments and functions.


Use best Python programming practices. Use powershell commands to execute necessary actions.

When creating output, follow the AngryGirls (AngrySparks) output syntax rules:
* Category is created by prefixing raid name with a single # symbol.
* A page is created by prefixing the name with a double ## symbol (similar to Markdown).

* Use World of Warcraft raid targets where appropriate such as {rt1} for star, {rt7} for cross, {rt8} for skull etc.
