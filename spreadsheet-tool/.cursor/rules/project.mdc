This script creates text assignments for World of Warcraft raid from Google spreadsheets.
This is a Python script which is invoked manually once per week.
This is a CLI tool.
The tool takes a single argument - path to a TOML file which contains: url to the Google spreadsheet, raid name: one of [MC, BWL, AQ40, Naxx], and page name in the spreadsheet.

The script reads a Google Sheets document or just one page, accesses separate cells, and prints out text assignments into a text file. The spreadsheet is publicly available by URL.

Prefer suggesting type hints for variables, arguments and functions.


Use best Python programming practices. Use powershell commands to execute necessary actions.
